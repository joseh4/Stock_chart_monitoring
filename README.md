# Stock_charts

The purpose of this project is to implement an algorithmic trading strategy in the stock market using python. The strategy hopes to  provide some help of when a good time to buy or sell may occur to make maximum profits. The strategy was not correct half of the time, but the overall use of this is applicable. When the SMA100 dips below the SMA100 and there is a sizeable difference, the prices of these stocks/options always go up. Although the strategy does not say this is a good time to buy, it should be noted.

### Project Scope and Background
The stock marhet and Forex markets are places where people are able to make lots of money, yet at the same time, lose a lot of money. I hope to give some insight on when to make the right trade using an algorithm that makes identifying these right times easier.

### Project Goals
 - Identify optimal times to enter/leave the market with a stock or option
